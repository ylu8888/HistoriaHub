                <h2 class="about-title">My Mission</h2>
                <p>To improve history education around the world and provide informational resources to passionate enthusiasts and learners of history. 
                    Whether you are a student, a professor, or just enjoy reading history as a pastime hobby. 
                    History is important to learn as it teaches about real-world events that occurred in the past. 
                    Which is all the more interesting if you pretend you're reading a fiction book, except it actually happened. 
                    Whether the historical events had a positive or negative impact, it's important to understand and reflect on them. 
                    Studying history helps us perceive the world today as we know it: the people and their countries, languages, relationships, cultures, technologies, and traditions.</p>

                <h2 class="about-title">My Story</h2>
                <p>As someone who is a passionate and avid reader of history, I often find myself reading Wiki/encyclopedia pages. I'll read about historical figures and events whenever I’m on the train, waiting in line, or just in my free time. 
                    I wanted to make a site where I could easily browse and study the topics that interest me most. 
                    I've taken two history courses this year in college (World History and US History), and I’m taking another one next semester too, so this site is useful for self-studying. 
                    Also, the quizzes can send me feedback on areas for improvement, which help with remembering and applying knowledge.</p>
